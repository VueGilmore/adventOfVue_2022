## Problem description

Christmas is coming soon! But how soon? ðŸ¤” Wouldn't it be nice to know exactly how many days, hours, minutes, and seconds are left until that magical day? In this challenge, you'll create a countdown to tell you exactly that.

Use the `useNow` composable from VueUse (preinstalled) to get a reactive version of the current time and then do the math to get days, hours, minutes, and seconds until Christmas.

If you're up for a bonus challenge use the Vue transition component to transition smoothly between each countdown number! ðŸš€
