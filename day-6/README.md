## Problem description

You're tasked with building an app that will compare how many X items one can obtain for roughly the same price as a single item Y. You're already given a baseline for `ItemSelect` and `ComparisonSummary` components and a `useItemComparison` composable, but you still have to implement the following:

- Obtain products from [DummyJSON's Prodcuts API (Get All Products endpoint)](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products) and display all entries along with their names and price tags inside a select input
- Show a comparison sentence in the `ComparisonSummray` component if two items have been chosen (eg. _You can buy 10 cheaper items for about the same price as a single expensive item_)
- If two items have the same `id`s, display _These are the same items_ message
