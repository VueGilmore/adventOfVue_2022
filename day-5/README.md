# Advent Of Vue 2022

## If you didn't get here from an email, read this section! Skip it otherwise.

[Advent Of Vue](https://adventofvue.com) is a series of 24 Vue coding challenges that are sent out every day from December 1 to December 24 via [a dedicated newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/AdventOfVue). If you'd like to receive more of these puzzles in the future, go ahead and sign up!

## Problem description

It's time to gift presents! And every present needs a label. So let's create our own gift label!

- Make the static `TO` and `FROM` fields dynamic so we can enter custom names.
- Below the label, add two input fields with two-way binding for the `TO` and `FROM` fields.
- When entering data into the input fields, the `TO` and `FROM` fields should dynamically update.
- Hint: you can look at the `./src/App.spec.js` file to see a specification of the desired outcome.
- Hint: you can run the tests with `npm run test` to see if your solution matches the specification.

If you like how, in this example, you can check your implementation with an existing test, you might be interested in my [book/newsletter about how to write good tests for Vue applications](https://goodvuetests.com/).
