[Advent Of Vue](https://adventofvue.com) is a series of 24 Vue coding challenges that are sent out every day from December 1 to December 24 via [a dedicated newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/AdventOfVue). If you'd like to receive more of these puzzles in the future, go ahead and sign up!

## Problem description

In this challenge, we need a way to put the presents under the tree! To do this we're going to use the Drag + Drop API.

There are a few parts:

1. Allowing the presents to be dragged
2. Allowing the tree to accept dragged items
3. Moving the dragged present from the `presents` array to the `underTheTree` array.

To complete this, you'll have to make some changes to `App.vue` - adding the proper event listeners and implementing the `startDrag` and `onDrop` methods!

Good luck.

If you'd like some more explanations/hints, here's a tutorial (with a video!) that I've made that covers some of these concepts:
