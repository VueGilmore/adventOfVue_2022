[Advent Of Vue](https://adventofvue.com) is a series of 24 Vue coding challenges that are sent out every day from December 1 to December 24 via [a dedicated newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/AdventOfVue). If you'd like to receive more of these puzzles in the future, go ahead and sign up!

## Problem description

We're going to take a Christmas tree with lights, and add the final piece â€” the ornaments!

For this challenge you'll be updating the `ChristmasTree` component in order to add ornaments in two different ways:

1. Add one ornament to each tree segment
2. Add alternating colours of ornaments to each tree segment

You're provided with a couple components that you won't need to touch, but feel free to explore them:

- `ChristmasLights`
- `ChristmasOrnament`
- `App` (see note below)

Note: to go from part 1 to part 2 you'll need to uncomment the `#even` and `#odd` named slots in `App.vue`, but this is the _only_ change you'll need to make in this file.

## Hints

## Example of a solution in action

This is what it should look like when you're done:
